Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Scripts

### `npm start`
Runs development mode in [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Visit [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more info.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. Visit [Deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more info.

### `npm run eject`
**Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into your project structure so you have full control over them.

All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. You don’t have to ever use `eject`.
